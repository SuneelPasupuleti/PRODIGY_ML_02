Clustering Algorithms

Clustering algorithms are powerful tools in machine learning for grouping similar data points together. In this study, we will explore four popular clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Affinity Propagation.

K-means Clustering:
K-means is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters based on the proximity of data points to the cluster centroids. It aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. K-means is computationally efficient and works well when clusters are well-separated and of similar size. It requires specifying the number of clusters in advance.

Hierarchical Clustering:
Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting existing clusters based on their similarity. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). Hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance and provides a dendrogram to visualize the clustering hierarchy.
